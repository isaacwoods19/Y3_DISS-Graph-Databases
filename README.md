# Y3_DISS-Graph-Databases
My third year dissertation project that uses graph databases to create an educational application. Coded in Java.

For my dissertation in my third year, I chose to focus on graph databases. This involved me researching this area, and then creating an application related to it as well as a detailed report on my findings work.

I chose to use Pokemon data to populate my graph database, because of the publicly available datasets on the internet and because of how relational the data is, allowing me to better show off the relational power of the graph database compared to a conventional SQL database.

The application I created interacted with the user like it is a 'Pokedex' - allowing the user to search for specific data (Pokemon) and how it relates to other data in the database. For example, the user could search for a specific Pokemon and all of its information, and also get a list of all Pokemon types that this pokemon is weak to.

The application also allowed the user to learn the graph database querying language called Cypher - which is similar to SQL but more powerful when dealing with data relationships. This section would suggest commands and show the raw output from the database, and let the user know when they've made a syntax mistake.

Overall this project took a lot of time and effort, but taught me a lot about databases - both graph and conventional. It took all of the academic year from October 2020 to June 2021. I recieved a 1st overall for the project.
